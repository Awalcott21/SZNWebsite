                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>SZN Studios was born from the belief that every season in life has its own unique message, inspired
                    by the timeless wisdom of Ecclesiastes in the Bible. Just like the changing seasons, life brings
                    moments of joy, growth, hardship, and reflection. At SZN Studios, we embrace the truth that it's
                    okay to not be okayâ€”because each season has a purpose. Our clothing is a reflection of this journey,
                    offering comfort and style as we navigate the highs and lows of life together.</p>
